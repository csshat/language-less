# Less (Less Hat)

[![Install in CSS Hat](http://img.shields.io/badge/install-to%20CSS%20Hat-blue.svg)](http://addons.csshat.com/?install=csshat/language-less-lesshat)

This is a template for [CSS Hat 2](https://csshat.com/) that generates code in [Less language](http://lesscss.org/) (using [LESS Hat Library](http://lesshat.com/)).

## Settings

### Inherit Font Styles

If you have a layer with more text styles, template will output just first complete style with all properties and the others will be just diffs (useful if they are childs of the main element - for example `<strong>` in `<p>`)

```css
font-family: "Helvetica";
font-size: 12px;

font-weight: bold;

```

### Selector

It will add curly braces and selector to the output

```css
.layer-name {
  color: #000000;
}
```

### SelectorTextStyle

You can choose text style

### Selector Type

We try to autogenerate a selector from layer name. You can choose which type it should be

| Option | Example |
| ------ | ------- |
| class | `.button` |
| id | `#button` |
| element | button`` |

### Color Type

Choose your preferred color syntax. 

> Note that if you select hex, sometimes it may actually output an `rgba`, because hex has no option to express alpha.

### Safe Mode

Use this if you are using an outdated Less compiler. It will wrap all mixin params to quotes, so Less Hat won't break. However in most cases - **do not use this option**.

### Show Text Snippet

If you have text layer with more styles (various text sizes, colors, â€¦), it will show you snippet of text in comment, so you know which rule relates to which part of content
