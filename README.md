# Less (Less Hat)

[![Install in CSS Hat](http://img.shields.io/badge/install-to%20CSS%20Hat-blue.svg)](https://csshat.com/addons.html?install=csshat/language-less-lesshat)

This is a template for [CSS Hat 2](https://csshat.com/) that generates code in [Less language](http://lesscss.org/) (using [LESS Hat Library](http://lesshat.com/)).

## Settings

### Inherit Font Styles

If you have a layer with more text styles, template will output just first complete style and the others will be just diffs (useful if they are childs of the main element - for example `<strong>` in `<p>`)
